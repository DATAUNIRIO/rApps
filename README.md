rApps
=====

This is the repo for all my current and future R applications.

Current applications hosted on **ShinyApps**:  

1. [**CrimeMap**](http://bit.ly/bib_crimemap): UK Crime Data Visualisation
2. [**heatmapStock**](http://bit.ly/bib_heatmapStock): Stock Market Calendar Heat Map 

For latest updates, please check out my blog [**"Blend it like a Bayesian!"**](http://bit.ly/blenditbayes).  

## Crime Data Visualisation ([CrimeMap](http://bit.ly/bib_crimemap))

The maturality and extensive graphical abilities of *R* and its packages make *R* an excellent choice for professional data visualisation. Previous work has shown that it is possible to combine the functionality in packages **ggmap**, **ggplot2**, **shiny** and **shinyapps** for crime data visualization in the form of a web application named **'CrimeMap'** ([Chow, 2013](http://bit.ly/bib_crimemap)). The web application is user-friendly and highly customizable. It allows users to create and customize spatial visualization in a few clicks without prior knowledge in *R* (see screenshot below). Moreover, **shiny** automatcially adjusts the layout of **'CrimeMap'**  for best viewing experience on desktop computers, tablets and smartphones.

For the history and motivation behind the developing of **CrimeMap**, please see my [**LondonR presentation**](http://bit.ly/londonr_crimemap).
